Beyond Headcounts: Productivity-Driven Growth in Advanced and Emerging Markets

# Brief Description

This study compares how five economies—Canada, China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States—have leveraged labor-force participation and productivity improvements to drive per-capita income growth between 1990 and 2023. Using harmonized World Bank indicators (real GDP per capita, GDP growth, and employment-to-population ratios), we identify three development trajectories: mature markets achieve high incomes with modest employment shifts; China’s rapid catch-up began with mass labor absorption before transitioning to productivity-led growth; and Japan now faces stagnation on both fronts. Correlation analysis highlights a clear shift from expanding headcounts to boosting output per worker as economies advance.
